## Overall

The workshop offers practical insights into leveraging EventBridge to automate tag compliance checks for AWS resources. By triggering periodic events, EventBridge scans resources, detects missing mandatory tags and sends alerts to administrator. A tag is a key-value pair that helps group and categorize resources on AWS for various use cases (environment, project, purpose, etc.)
